Hi Omid-

I'm attaching source code that generates the data for our experiments with SVM as well as two methods that more generally 
solve the problem (DistributedMinimize.m and DistributedProjectedSubgrad.m). I believe to make all the code run, 
you'll need to have CVX installed (http://cvxr.com/cvx/).

Cheers,
John
